           libsbml NEWS -- History of user-visible changes


=== Version 1.1.2 ===

* A new subdirectory, examples, contains a few small programs that
  demonstrate how libsbml may be used.

* IEEE-754 NaN, +Inf, -Inf and -0.0 are handled correctly and
  consistenly on all supported platforms.  In previous versions, these
  values were not represented, read or written correctly on native
  Windows and under Cygwin.

  When writing these values to XML, libsbml now strictly adheres to the
  XML Schema specification for doubles, namely exactly: "NaN", "INF",
  "-INF" and "-0".

* The build platform was upgraded to Libtool 1.5.  This means dynamic
  libraries should build correctly on all platforms: Cygwin (.DLL),
  Linux (.so) and MacOS X (.dylib).

* SBMLWriter now defaults to an ouput encoding of UTF-8.


* Released June 5, 2003




=== Version 1.1.0 ====

* A Developer's Manual (DRAFT) is available in docs/formatted/.

* Formula strings may optionally be parsed into abstract syntax trees.
  See ASTNode.h, and SBML_parseFormula() in FormulaParser.h.

* XXX_isSetYYY() and XXX_unsetYYY() methods are available for optional
  fields without default values.

* XXX_getYYY() and XXX_setYYY() methods are available for every field.

* SBML (XML) namespace handling is much improved.

* '<annotations>' is treated as a synonym for the correct form
  '<annotation>' (singular).

* Notes and annotations on the top-level <sbml> element are read-in
  and stored (SBMLDocument_t now "inherits" from SBase_t), but not
  written.  When this occurs, a warning message is logged.

* Builds successfully on Solaris 2.8.

* SBML documents may now be validated against their XML schema.  This
  is still off by default.  To turn validation on see
  SBMLReader_create(), SBMLReader_readSBML() and possibly SBMLReader.h
  for more information.

* Three new convenience functions exist to quickly print warnings,
  errors and fatal errors that occurred while reading an SBMLDocument.
  The prototype for this class of function is:

    SBMLDocument_printXXXs(SBMLDocument_t *d, FILE *stream).

  Where XXX is Warning, Error or Fatal.


* Released May 11, 2003.




=== Version 1.0.1 ====

* The build system detects and supports Xerces-C 2.1.0, Xerces-C 2.2.0
  compiled with or without namespace support.

* Released March 14, 2003.




=== Version 1.0.0 ===

* Initial release, March 12, 2003.
