           libsbml NEWS -- History of user-visible changes


=== Version 1.1.0 ====

* SBML (XML) namespace handling is much improved.

* '<annotations>' is treated as a synonym for the correct form
  '<annotation>' (singular).

* Notes and annotations on the top-level <sbml> element are read-in
  and stored (SBMLDocument_t now "inherits" from SBase_t), but not
  written.  When this occurs, a warning message is logged.

* Builds successfully on Solaris 2.8.

* SBML documents may now be validated against their XML schema.  This
  is still off by default.  To turn validation on see
  SBMLReader_create(), SBMLReader_readSBML() and possibly SBMLReader.h
  for more information.

* Three new convenience functions exist to quickly print warnings,
  errors and fatal errors that occurred while reading an SBMLDocument.
  The prototype for this class of function is:

    SBMLDocument_printXXXs(SBMLDocument_t *d, FILE *stream).

  Where XXX is Warning, Error or Fatal.


* Released April xx, 2003.

  compiled with or without namespace support.

* Released March 14, 2003.




=== Version 1.0.0 ===

* Initial release, March 12, 2003.
