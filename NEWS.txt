           libsbml NEWS -- History of user-visible changes


=== Version 2.0.1 ===

* The correct namespace is now output for SBML Level 2 documents.
  This fixes a bug in version 2.0.0.

* SBML_convertToL2(SBase_t *sb) converts any SBML Level 1 object and
  its subordinate objects to SBML Level 2.  Currently this function
  only converts name fields to id fields, however, in the future it
  will:

    - Add ModifierSpeciesReferences when converting L1 Reactions.
    - Add FunctionDefinitions for L1 predefined functions.

  SBMLDocument_setLevel() calls this function automatically when the
  current level is 1 and the new level is 2.

* Released July 23, 2003




=== Version 2.0.0 ===

* Near complete L2 support.  The two features not yet supported are:

    1. RDF (although the metaid attribute is read, stored and written)

    2. Processing of the MathML <semantic> element (for annotating
       MathML elements with additional content, e.g. TeX).


* New L2 Structures:

    - FunctionDefinition
    - Event
    - EventAssignment
    - SimpleSpeciesReference    (abstract)
    - ModifierSpeciesReference
    - AssignmentRule            (no longer abstract)
    - RateRule

    - MathML and L1 infix expressions (when parsed) are both stored in
      the same Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure ASTNode.

    - ListOf stores lists of others SBML objects and may contain a
      metaid, notes or annotations.


* New L2 Functions:

    - The getters, setters, isSet and unset functions are too numerous
      to mention here.  Like L1, they parallel the UML structures
      defined in the SBML specification.  All L1 functions are kept
      for backward compatibility (see below).

    - Any structure containing a list now has a getListOfXXX()
      function which returns the corresponding ListOf structure.

    - There are currently three convenience functions for converting
      between SBML infix and MathML formulae:

        - ASTNode_t *SBML_parseFormula(const char *formula)
        - char      *SBML_formulaToString(const ASTNode_t *math)
        - ASTNode_t *readMathMLFromString(cont char *xml)

      Again, these are provided purely for convenience.  Under normal
      circumstances, libsbml performs all conversions behind the
      scenes when necessary.


* L1 to L2 Changes:

  libsbml stores both L1 and L2 models in the same memory structure.
  While the L1 getters, setters, isSet and unset functions exist for
  backward compatibility there are some changes of which users of
  previous versions of libsbml should be aware:

    - Compartment:

        - .volume has been renamed to .size.

    - Species:

        - .units has been renamed to .substanceUnits.

        - .initialAmount and .initialConcentration are stored in a
          union called .initial with discriminators .Amount and
          .Concentration.

    - Reaction:

        - .fast is optional in L2 which introduces Reaction_isSet /
          unsetFast() functions.

    - SpeciesReference:

        - .stoichiometry is now of type double which necessitated a
          change in the signature of the getter and setter functions.

        - The use of .denominator is deprecated in L2.

          However, libsbml still uses denominator in L2 models.  When
          reading a <stoichiometry Math> if the content is a single
          <CNN type='rational'>, libsbml will discard the
          stoichiometry Math and set stoichiometry and denominator
          directly.  Similarly, libsbml will write <stoichiometryMath>
          in L2 documents if the .stoichiometryMath field is not set
          and the denominator is not 1.

    - CompartmentVolumeRule:
    - SpeciesConcentrationRule:
    - ParameterRule:

        - .compartment, .species and .parameter have all been renamed
          to .variable.

    - The XXX_createWith() functions now set the .id field instead of
      the .name field.

    - List_t has been replaced by ListOf_t to store a metaid, notes,
      and annotations.  ListOf_t is simply a wrapper around List_t.


* SBMLReader allows you to set up to three Schema filenames (one each
  for L1v1, L1v2 and L2v1) and it will automatically use the
  appropriate Schema for the SBML document being read.

* A simple command-line executable that converts L1 models to L2 was
  added to the examples/ subdirectory.

* A new subdirectory, xml-schemas/, contains schemas for SBML L1v1,
  L1v2, L2v1 and MathML 2.

* Xerces-C 2.3.0 is now supported by libsbml.  Older versions of
  Xerces-C (2.2.0 and 2.1.0) are still supported.


* Released July 23, 2003




=== Version 1.1.2 ===

* A new subdirectory, examples, contains a few small programs that
  demonstrate how libsbml may be used.

* IEEE-754 NaN, +Inf, -Inf and -0.0 are handled correctly and
  consistently on all supported platforms.  In previous versions, these
  values were not represented, read or written correctly on native
  Windows and under Cygwin.

  When writing these values to XML, libsbml now strictly adheres to the
  XML Schema specification for doubles, namely exactly: "NaN", "INF",
  "-INF" and "-0".

* The build platform was upgraded to Libtool 1.5.  This means dynamic
  libraries will build correctly on all platforms: Linux (.so),
  Solaris (.so), Cygwin (.DLL) and MacOS X (.dylib).

* SBMLWriter now defaults to an output encoding of UTF-8.

* SBML_parseFormula() now returns NULL if the formula contains an
  error.  The next version of libsbml will return the position of the
  syntax error.

* Added method: SBMLDocument_setModel().

* To build and run the libsbml test suite now requires an explicit
  configure option:

    ./configure  --enable-check

  In addition, 'check' needs to be installed (http://check.sf.net/).
  Under Cygwin ONLY, due to a limitation of Libtool, if libsbml is
  built with --check-enabled, a DLL cannot be built.  So, after
  testing, re-run configure without enabling check then 'make' and
  'make install' as usual.

  Running the test suite on any platform is completely optional.
  Libsbml is tested on all supported platforms before it is released.


* Released June 6, 2003




=== Version 1.1.0 ====

* A Developer's Manual (DRAFT) is available in docs/formatted/.

* Formula strings may optionally be parsed into abstract syntax trees.
  See ASTNode.h, and SBML_parseFormula() in FormulaParser.h.

* XXX_isSetYYY() and XXX_unsetYYY() methods are available for optional
  fields without default values.

* XXX_getYYY() and XXX_setYYY() methods are available for every field.

* SBML (XML) namespace handling is much improved.

* '<annotations>' is treated as a synonym for the correct form
  '<annotation>' (singular).

* Notes and annotations on the top-level <sbml> element are read-in
  and stored (SBMLDocument_t now "inherits" from SBase_t), but not
  written.  When this occurs, a warning message is logged.

* Builds successfully on Solaris 2.8.

* SBML documents may now be validated against their XML schema.  This
  is still off by default.  To turn validation on see
  SBMLReader_create(), SBMLReader_readSBML() and possibly SBMLReader.h
  for more information.

* Three new convenience functions exist to quickly print warnings,
  errors and fatal errors that occurred while reading an SBMLDocument.
  The prototype for this class of function is:

    SBMLDocument_printXXXs(SBMLDocument_t *d, FILE *stream).

  Where XXX is Warning, Error or Fatal.


* Released May 11, 2003.




=== Version 1.0.1 ====

* The build system detects and supports Xerces-C 2.1.0, Xerces-C 2.2.0
  compiled with or without namespace support.

* Released March 14, 2003.




=== Version 1.0.0 ===

* Initial release, March 12, 2003.
