 * @class Priority
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %Priority construct for %Event.
 *
 * An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
 * are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
 * effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of
 * the condition which invokes it.  The priority assigned to an event 
 * is defined using an
 * object of class Priority.
 *
 * The object class Priority is derived from SBase and adds a single
 * subelement called "math".  This subelement is used to hold MathML
 * content.  The mathematical formula represented by "math" must evaluate
 * to a numerical value.
