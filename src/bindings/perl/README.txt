LibSBML -- Perl5 interface to the SBML Library v2.1.0

DESCRIPTION:
------------

This module provides a Perl5 bindings for the SBML Library. It gives
access to almost all functions in libSBML. For more information about
SBML or libSBML, please contact the SBML team http://sbml.org
(mailto:sbml-team@caltech.edu).

The Perl5 wrapper is generated by processing the interface-file
LibSBML.i with SWIG v1.3.21. Unfortunately SWIG v1.3.21 does not
provide a %feature("shadow") directive for Perl5 which allows one to
override functions in the SWIG generated module file by user provided
code.

To overcome this, the SWIG generated LibSBML.pm file is patched
automatically by applying the perlscript patchLibSBML to LibSBML.pm
during the build process.  (the patch application is triggered by the
absence of the LibSBML_wrap.cxx)

patchLibSBML essentially extracts the %feature("shadow") from the end of
the local.i file and puts them into the LibSBML.pm at the appropriate
position.

INSTALLATION:
------------

Just follow the usual procedure:
   
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you don't have permission to install a module into the
perl-directory-tree, you can alternatively install this module into
your home directory. First create an installation directory, e.g.
WHATSOEVER/Perl/L . To install this module into WHATSOEVER/Perl/L do
the following:

   perl Makefile.PL LIB=WHATSOEVER/Perl/L
   make
   make test
   make install

You can use the perl command-line switch -I to prepend the locally
installed module to the search path for modules (perldoc perlrun).
