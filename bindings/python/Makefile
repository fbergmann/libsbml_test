##
## NOTES:
##
## Until the appropriate autoconf/automake support comes online:
##
## - CPPFLAGS CFLAGS, LDFLAGS are assumed to come from the user's
##   environment.
##
## - CPPFLAGS should contain one or more include paths (-Ipath) that
##   point to *installed* libsbml and either Xerces-C++ or Expat
##   header files.  Building the SWIG module against an uninstalled
##   libsbml.la in ../src requires a better understanding of libtool.
##
## - LDFLAGS should contain one more library paths (-Lpath) that
##   point to libsbml.so and either libxerces-c.so and/or libexpat.so.
##
## - For Linux/Unix LD_LIBRARY_PATH *may* need to contain one or more
##   library paths to libsbml.so, libxerces-c.so and/or libexpat.so
##   and/or the libsbml.so _libsbml.so generated by this Makfile.
##   (For BSD/MacOS X replace LD_LIBRARY_PATH with DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH.)
##
## - MacOS X requires both -lsbml and -lxerces-c (-lexpat) LIBS be
##   specified when linking.  Linux requires only -lsbml.
##
## - There is no install process (yet) for the library generated by this
##   Makefile.

CC  = gcc
CXX = g++


##
## Linux
##
PYTHON    = /usr/bin/python
SWIGFLAGS = $(CPPFLAGS)
XCPPFLAGS = $(CPPFLAGS) -I../swig -I/usr/include/python2.2
XCFLAGS   = $(CFLAGS) -shared
XLDFLAGS  = $(LDFLAGS) -L/usr/lib/python2.2/config
LIBS      = -lsbml


##
## The two MacOS X blocks below may be out-of-date w.r.t. to the more
## recent Linux block above.  Please update if necessary.
##


##
## MacOS X with custom-built Python 2.3 installed in /usr/local/
## Another case to consider: Is there a Fink distribution of Python?
##
#PYTHON    = /usr/local/bin/python2.3
#XCPPFLAGS = $(CPPFLAGS) -I/usr/local/include/python2.3
#XCFLAGS   = $(CFLAGS) -bundle -bundle_loader $(PYTHON)
#XLDFLAGS  = $(LDFLAGS) -L/usr/local/lib/python2.3/config/
#LIBS      = -lsbml -lxerces-c


##
## MacOS X 10.3 with the Python 2.3 Framework installed (comes w/ Panther?!)
##
#PYTHON    = /usr/bin/python
#PYTHONDIR = /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3
#XCPPFLAGS = $(CPPFLAGS) -I$(PYTHONDIR)/include/python2.3
#XCFLAGS   = $(CFLAGS) -bundle -framework Python
#XLDFLAGS  = $(LDFLAGS) -L$(PYTHONDIR)/lib/python2.3/lib-dynload
#LIBS     = -lsbml -lxerces-c


all: _libsbml.so

_libsbml.so: libsbml_wrap.cpp
	$(CXX) $(XCPPFLAGS) $(XCFLAGS) $(XLDFLAGS) $< -o $@ $(LIBS)

libsbml_wrap.cpp: libsbml.i
	swig $(SWIGFLAGS) -c++ -python -o libsbml_wrap.cpp libsbml.i

clean:
	/bin/rm -f libsbml_wrap.cpp libsbml.py *.o *.so *.pyc
