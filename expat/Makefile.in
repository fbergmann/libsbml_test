# Some of the following are substituted automatically by `configure'.  If
# you are looking at "Makefile", do not edit these values; instead, run the
# configure script at the top level of the src tree.  It will recreate
# "Makefile".

# `srcdir' points to the current directory, but should be set by configure.
# `subdir' must be set manually to the relative dir under `srcdir'.  Don't 
# set `subdir' to an absolute path, or some `make' actions will fail.

# Variables `headers', `sources', `libraries', `extra_CPPFLAGS',
# `extra_CXXFLAGS', `extra_LDFLAGS' and `distfiles' are used by the default
# rules in `makefile-common-actions.mk' included at the end.
