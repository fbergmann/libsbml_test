# The values of the following variables are obtained using the libSBML
# configuration program.

CLASSPATH = ../../src/bindings/java/libsbmlj.jar:.

JAVA      = @JAVA@
JAVAC     = @JAVAC@
JFLAGS    = -classpath $(CLASSPATH)

# The rest of this Makefile remains static regardless of the values
# assigned to the variables above.

          translateMath.class validateSBML.class evaluateMath.class

all: $(classes)

# The following is the generic rule for making a .class file from one of
# the .java files in this directory.  The funny business with evaluateMath
# is because we have to use a special rule later below that takes into
# account the fact that evaluateMath needs Java version 1.5 or higher.

$(filter-out evaluateMath.class,$(classes)): %.class: %.java libSBMLHelper.java
ifeq "@JAVA@" ""
	@echo "libSBML must be configured with --with-java to use the Java bindings."

# The following is a special case for evaluateMath because it requires JDK 1.5.
