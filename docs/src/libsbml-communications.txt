/** @page libsbml-communications Bug Reports, Mailing Lists, and Related Topics

@section bugs Reporting bugs and other problems

We invite you to report bugs and other problems using the issue tracker for
libSBML on SourceForge.  The following URL will take you there directly: <a
href="http://sbml.org/software/libsbml/issue-tracker">http://sbml.org/software/libsbml/issue-tracker</a>.

You can also report problems on the libsbml-discuss mailing list (see next
section).  This may even have advantages, such as that other people may
also have experienced the issue and offer a workaround more quickly than
the libSBML developers can respond.


@section libsbml-discuss The libsbml-discuss mailing list 

If you use libSBML, we highly recommend that you subscribe or monitor the
<a href="http://www.sbml.org/forums">libsbml-discuss</a> mailing list.
Being a member of libsbml-discuss will enable you to keep in touch with the
latest developments in libSBML as well as to ask questions and share your
experiences with fellow developers and users of libSBML.  The mailing list
is vigilantly moderated by humans to prevent spam and off-topic postings.

A web-based interface is available at http://sbml.org/forums/ for those who
prefer to interact with the list via a web interface.

The libsbml-discuss archives are also available at http://sbml.org/forums/.


@section cvs The CVS notification mailing list

If you are obtaining your libSBML files directly from the CVS repository on
SourceForge, you may wish to subscribe to the mailing list
sbml-cvs-libsbml, to be apprised of changes to the CVS repository as soon
as they are committed.  You can join the list by visiting the URL <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sbml-cvs-libsbml">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sbml-cvs-libsbml</a>.
