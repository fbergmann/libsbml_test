/* The following is a shocking hack to force a section heading in front of
   the list of function declarations on "group" pages in the docs.  It works
   in concert with doxygen-layout-c.xml, which defines the <group> section to
   put <groupgraph> right in front of <memberdecl>.  The HTML output for
   <groupgraph> has a <div> with a class of "dynheader", and this div is
   immediately followed by the "dyncontent" div for a diagram.  We don't need
   the diagram (it's useless in our system), so the following hides
   "dyncontent" and hijacks the "dynheader" to use it to show completely
   different text.  The CSS selectors below rely on the the fact that even
   though dynheader is used in other pages in the doxygen output, the element
   hierarchy on groups pages in particular puts dynheader as an immediate
   child of the "contents" <div>.  This makes these changes only affect our
   groups pages. */

div.contents > div.dynheader:before {
    display: block;
    content: "Function Declarations";
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Sans, sans-serif;
    font-size: 14pt;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #383838;
    line-height: 120%;
    margin-top: 1em;
    margin-bottom: 0em;
}

div.contents > div.dynheader {
    /* We can't use display: none here because then no part of the element
       will be shown, and we won't be able to use the CSS code above.  So,
       the following sets the content color of the dynheader <div> to white,
       making the content text invisible.  Wow, is this gross or what?  */
    color: white;
}

div.contents > div.dyncontent {
    display: none;
