Jouraku, Ben Kovitz, Michael Hucka, and many others in the SBML
community</em>.

Michael Hucka wrote most of this libSBML user and API
documentation.

<p>
This manual describes the application programming interface (API) of
libSBML, an open-source (LGPL) library for writing and manipulating the
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).  This version of the library
supports all versions of SBML Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2 (which includes
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3 at the time of this writing).  For more
information about SBML, please see the references or visit <a
href="http://www.sbml.org/">http://www.sbml.org/</a> on the Internet.
Please report bugs and other issues with libSBML using the tracker at <a
href="http://sbml.org/software/libsbml/issue-tracker">
http://sbml.org/software/libsbml/issue-tracker</a>.

<p style="color: #880000; border: 1px dotted gray; padding: 3px"><em>Note
to readers</em>: This manual is generated automatically from the C++ source
code of libSBML, and owing to imperfections in the conversion software, it
is not as complete as the C++ API manual.  If you encounter undocumented
members (such as constants), you may wish to check the corresponding text
in the C++ API manual.
