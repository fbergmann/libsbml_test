The continued improvement of libSBML is crucially dependent on your
feedback.  Below are some means of discussing and sharing your
experiences.

<h2>Reporting bugs and other problems</h2>

<p> Please report problems and other issues using the issue tracker for
libSBML on SourceForge: <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/issue-tracker">http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/issue-tracker</a>.

<p> You can also report problems on the <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.sbml.org/Forums">sbml-interoperability</a> mailing list
(see next section).  This may have advantages, such as that other people
may also have experienced the same issue and offer a workaround more
quickly than the libSBML developers can respond.

<p> Finally, if you want to contact the libSBML developers directly, you
can email them at <a
href="mailto:libsbml-team@caltech.edu">libsbml-team@caltech.edu</a>.


<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p> If you use SBML (which seems likely, if you are using libSBML), we urge
you to sign up for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sbml.org/Forums">sbml-announce</a>,
the SBML announcements mailing list.  It is a low-volume, broadcast-only
list where new releases of SBML and other important events are announced.
These announcements are not cross-posted to the other lists below, so it's
important to subscribe to sbml-announce even if you subscribe to the other
lists below.

<p> In addition, if you use libSBML, we highly recommend that you subscribe
or monitor the mailing list <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.sbml.org/Forums">sbml-interoperability</a>.  Subscribing
to this list will enable you to keep in touch with the latest developments
in libSBML as well as to ask questions and share your experiences with
fellow users and developers of libSBML and other SBML software.  The
mailing list is vigilantly moderated by humans to prevent spam and
off-topic postings.

<p> If you are interested in delving more deeply into libSBML, perhaps to
make extensions and modifications, we recommend that you also subscribe or
monitor the mailing list <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.sbml.org/Forums">libsbml-development</a>.  Being a member
of this list will enable you to keep in touch with the latest developments
in libSBML as well as to ask questions and share your experiences with
fellow developers and users of libSBML.

<p> RSS notification as well as a web-based interface for both lists is
available at <a target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Forums/">http://sbml.org/Forums/</a>,
for those who prefer to interact with the list via a web interface.

<p> The mailing list archives are also available at <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/Forums/">http://sbml.org/Forums/</a>.


<h2>The SVN notification mailing list</h2>

<p> If you are obtaining your libSBML files directly from the SVN
repository on SourceForge, you may wish to subscribe to the mailing list
sbml-svn, to be apprised of changes to the SVN repository as soon as they
are committed.  You can join the list by visiting the URL <a target="_blank"
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sbml-svn">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sbml-svn</a>.
