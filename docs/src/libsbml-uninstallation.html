<p> In order to uninstall libSBML from a computer system, please follow the
instructions below depending on the kind of operating system involved.


<h3><a class="anchor" name="uninstall-unix">Linux, MacOS&nbsp;X, and
Solaris</a></h3>

<p>
The libSBML build system comes with a command for uninstalling libSBML
suitable for removing the software on UNIX-based systems.  To invoke it, go
to a terminal shell, move to the libSBML source directory (i.e., where you
previously built libSBML), and execute the following command:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  make uninstall
</pre></div>

<p>
This command will remove everything that was installed by the last
<code>make install</code> command.

<p> (Note that there is a potential problem if you have run
<code>configure</code> with different options than were configured when you
performed the last <code>make install</code>.  The libSBML uninstallation
command will only know about what was <em>last</em> configured.  If you run
<code>configure</code>, then <code>make install</code>, then run
<code>configure</code> again with different options, and finally try
<code>make uninstall</code>, it will only attempt to uninstall the files
implied by the most recent run of <code>configure</code>, not the files
installed by the original <code>make install</code>.)
