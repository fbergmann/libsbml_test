<p> In order to uninstall libSBML from a computer system, please follow the
instructions below depending on the kind of operating system involved.


<h3><a class="anchor" name="uninstall-unix">Linux, Cygwin and similar
Unix-like systems</a></h3>

<p>
The libSBML build system comes with a command for uninstalling libSBML
suitable for removing the software on UNIX-based systems.  To invoke it, go
to a terminal shell, move to the libSBML source directory (i.e., where you
previously built libSBML), and execute the following command:

<pre class="fragment">
  make uninstall
</pre>

<p>
This command will remove everything that was installed by the last
<code>make install</code> command.

<p> (Note that there is a potential problem if you have run
<code>configure</code> with different options than were configured when you
performed the last <code>make install</code>.  The libSBML uninstallation
command will only know about what was <em>last</em> configured.  If you run
<code>configure</code>, then <code>make install</code>, then run
<code>configure</code> again with different options, and finally try
<code>make uninstall</code>, it will only attempt to uninstall the files
implied by the most recent run of <code>configure</code>, not the files
installed by the original <code>make install</code>.)



<h3><a class="anchor" name="uninstall-windows">Windows</a></h3>

<p>On Windows, you have two possible approaches for uninstalling libSBML.
You can use either approach.
<ol>

<li>The first approach is to use the regular Windows <em>add/remove
software</em> interface, available in the Windows control panel.

<li>The second is to use libSBML's uninstaller directly. As part of the
installation process on Windows, the libSBML installer program places an
uninstaller program in the top-level folder where libSBML is installed.
This uninstaller is named <code>Uninstall_libSBML.bat</code>.  To use it,
navigate to the libSBML installation folder (which might be, for example,
<code>C:\Program Files\SBML\libSBML-3.1.1-expat</code>) and execute
<code>Uninstall_libSBML.bat</code>.  It will remove the files installed by
the libSBML Windows installer.  

</ol>


<h3><a class="anchor" name="uninstall-macos">Mac OS X</a></h3>

<p>The Mac OS X installer for libSBML places an uninstall script in the
<code>bin</code> subdirectory of the location where you installed libSBML.
(This location is <code>/usr/local</code> by default.)  To run the
uninstaller, start a terminal shell and type the following command at the
prompt:

<pre class="fragment">
  sudo /usr/local/bin/uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh
</pre>

<p>If, on the other hand, you built and installed libSBML from the source
distribution, then you can use the <nobr><code>make uninstall</code></nobr>
command <a href="#uninstall-unix">mentioned above</a>.
