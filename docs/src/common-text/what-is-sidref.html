<p>
In SBML, object identifiers are of a type called <code>SId</code>.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;3, an explicit data type called <code>SIdRef</code> was introduced
for attribute values that refer to <code>SId</code> values; in previous
Levels of SBML, this data type did not exist and attributes were simply
described to as "referring to an identifier", but the effective data type was
the same as Level&nbsp;3's <code>SIdRef</code>.  These and other methods of
libSBML refer to the type <code>SIdRef</code> for all Levels of SBML, even if
the corresponding SBML specification did not explicitly name the data type.
