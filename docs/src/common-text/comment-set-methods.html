<em>Some words of explanation about the</em>
<code>set</code>/<code>unset</code>/<code>isSet</code> <em>methods</em>:
SBML define certain attributes on some classes of objects as optional.
This requires an application to be careful about the distinction between
two cases: (1) a given attribute has <em>never</em> been set to a value,
and therefore should be assumed to have the SBML-defined default value, and
(2) a given attribute has been set to a value, but the value happens to be
an empty string.  LibSBML supports these distinctions by providing methods
to set, unset, and query the status of attributes that are optional.  The
methods have names of the form
<code>set</code><em><span class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em><code>(...)</code>,
<code>unset</code><em><span class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em><code>()</code>, and
<code>isSet</code><em><span class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em><code>()</code>,
where <em><span class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em>
is the the name of the optional attribute in question.
