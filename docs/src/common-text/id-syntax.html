The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML identifier type 
<code>SId</code>, which defines the permitted syntax of identifiers.  We
express the syntax using an extended form of BNF notation: 
<pre style="margin-left: 2em; border: none; font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: black">
letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
digit  ::= '0'..'9'
idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*
</pre>
The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping, the
character <code>*</code> "zero or more times", and the character
<code>|</code> indicates logical "or".  The equality of SBML identifiers is
determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e., comparisons must be
performed in a case-sensitive manner.  In addition, there are a few
conditions for the uniqueness of identifiers in an SBML model.  Please
consult the SBML specifications for the exact formulations.
