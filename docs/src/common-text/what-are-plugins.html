SBML Level&nbsp;3 consists of a <em>Core</em> definition that can be extended
via optional SBML Level&nbsp;3 <em>packages</em>.  A given model may indicate
that it uses one or more SBML packages, and likewise, a software tool may be
able to support one or more packages.  LibSBML does not come preconfigured
with all possible packages included and enabled, in part because not all
package specifications have been finalized.  To support the ability for
software systems to enable support for the Level&nbsp;3 packages they choose,
libSBML features a <em>plug-in</em> mechanism.  Each SBML Level&nbsp;3
package is implemented in a separate code plug-in that can be enabled by the
application to support working with that SBML package.  A given SBML model
may thus contain not only objects defined by SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core, but also
objects created by libSBML plug-ins supporting additional Level&nbsp;3
packages.
