In SBML, unit definitions have identifiers of type <code>UnitSId</code>.  In
SBML Level&nbsp;3, an explicit data type called <code>UnitSIdRef</code> was
introduced for attribute values that refer to <code>UnitSId</code> values; in
previous Levels of SBML, this data type did not exist and attributes were
simply described to as "referring to a unit identifier", but the effective
data type was the same as Level&nbsp;3's <code>UnitSIdRef</code>.  These and
other methods of libSBML refer to the type <code>UnitSIdRef</code> for all
Levels of SBML, even if the corresponding SBML specification did not
explicitly name the data type.
