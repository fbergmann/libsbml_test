In SBML, object "meta" identifiers are of the XML data type <code>ID</code>;
the SBML object attribute itself is typically named <code>metaid</code>.  All
attributes that hold values <em>referring</em> to values of type
<code>ID</code> are of the XML data type <code>IDREF</code>.  They are also
sometimes informally referred to as "metaid refs", in analogy to the
SBML-defined type <code>SIdRef</code>.
