This section documents known problems, limitations, and possible pitfalls
in using libSBML.

<h2>Conformance to SBML</h2>

<p>
As of version 3.0.0, libSBML supports all of SBML Level 1 Versions 1 and 2,
and SBML Level 2 Versions 1, 2, and 3, with the exception of the following
still-unsupported aspects:
<ul>
<li>Support for MathML's <code>semantics</code> elements</li>
<li>Support for MathML's <code>annotation</code> elements</li>
<li>Support for MathML's <code>annotation-xml</code> elements</li>
</ul>


<h2>Name collisions in mathematical expressions</h2>

<p>
In the C-like, text-based, formula expression syntax supported by libSBML
and used in SBML Level 1, four constants are reserved words:
<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>exponentiale</code> and
<code>pi</code>.  Most of them will not easily lead to a name collision,
but unfortunately, the character sequence <code>pi</code> <em>is</em> also
sometimes used as a species identifier by biological modelers (e.g., to use
"Pi" to represent a phosphate ion).  If the string "<code>pi</code>" or
"<code>Pi</code>" appears in a text string passed to a libSBML method that
interprets formulas, it will be interpreted as the mathematical constant
&#960; (pi).  For example, the expression <em>2 * Pi</em> will yield

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;
    &lt;times/&gt;
    &lt;cn type="integer"&gt; 2 &lt;/cn&gt;
    &lt;pi/&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
This problem exists for all four of the constants mentioned above, but is
most commonly encountered in the context of "pi".  Currently, the only ways
to avoid this problem are either to avoid using the strings "pi" and "Pi"
in this context, or to avoid using the text-string expressions altogether
and instead use ASTs.  All libSBML methods that accept text-string
mathematical formulas have variants that accept ASTs instead.


<h2>Differences in XML parser behavior</h2>

<p> The different parsers supported by libSBML (Xerces, Expat, libxml2)
behave slightly differently when reading files, and the differences are
difficult for libSBML to hide.  The following are the differences of which
we are currently aware:

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Expat and libxml2 tend to quit earlier than
Xerces when they encounter an XML error in an input stream, whereas Xerces
tends to process the input further and report an error as being on the
element in which the XML error occurs.  The result is that the first error
reported by libSBML is sometimes different, depending on which of the
underlying XML parsers is being used.  In our tests this affects almost
exclusively low-level XML syntax errors (such as start/end tag mismatches,
unterminated strings) and not SBML errors per se, although a basic XML
error can of course mask other, more substantive errors.  The exceptional
cases (the reason for the "almost" in the previous sentence) concern SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3 validation rules 10309 (detection of metaid
syntax), and rules 10802, 10803, 21004 and 21005 (detection of disallowed
XML constructs inside <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> elements).</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Xerces 2.5 and 2.7 (and probably other
versions) under Windows apparently suffers from a bug in transcoding
multibyte UTF-8 characters.  The underlying reason for the problem is that
the Xerces transcoding functions in the Xerces 2.7 file
<code>Win32TransService.cpp</code> calls the Windows transcoding function
<code>WideCharToMultiByte</code> with a first argument of
<code>CP_ACP</code> (meaning the Windows ANSI code page) rather than
<code>CP_UTF8</code>.  Why this is the case is a mystery to us.  The effect
is that Xerces on Windows does not translate some non-text UTF-8 characters
the same way as on other platforms.</li>

</ol>



<h2>Possible unexpected <code>make uninstall</code> behavior</h2>

<p> The libSBML <code>make uninstall</code> command on Linux, MacOS, Cygwin,
and Solaris only knows about the features <em>most recently</em> configured
into libSBML.  If you run <code>configure</code>, then <code>make
install</code>, then run <code>configure</code> again with different
options, and finally try <code>make uninstall</code>, the result will be to
attemp removing the files implied by the most recent run of
<code>configure</code>, <em>not</em> the files installed by the
<em>original</em> <code>make install</code>.



<h2>Warnings during creation of documentation</h2>

<p> If you run the commands to generate the libSBML documentation, there
will be warnings printed for all except the C++ documentation.  These
warnings still exist as of version 3.0.2 of libSBML.  Most of the warnings
are known incompatibilities that are next to impossible to resolve between
the different tools used to generate different versions of the API
documentation.  It is probably safe to ignore them.  Hopefully the warnings
will be eliminated in a future version of libSBML.
