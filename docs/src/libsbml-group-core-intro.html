<p>The classes listed here constitute libSBML's implementation of SBML Levels
1&ndash;3 Core, without any SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages; the extensions that
implement Level&nbsp;3 packages (if any enabled in your copy of libSBML) are
listed in a separate section of this manual.

<h2>The SBML specification</h2>

<p style="color: #880000"> This API documentation for libSBML does not
provide a complete explanation of SBML Level&nbsp;3.  If you are developing software that uses
&ldquo;SBML&rdquo;, you are strongly urged to read the actual specification.
For your convenience, the current (at the time of this
libSBML release) specification document is provided below.  Other levels and versions of SBML are also supported by libSBML, and can be found at <A HREF="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">sbml.org</a>.
