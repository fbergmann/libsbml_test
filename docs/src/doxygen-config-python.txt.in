# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "@PACKAGE_NAME@ Python Public API"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = "@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@ Python Public API"

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

HTML_OUTPUT            = ../formatted/python-api

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not
# want to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should
# set this tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations
# and definitions whose arguments contain STL classes
# (e.g. func(std::string); v.s. func(std::string) {}). This also make the
# inheritance and collaboration diagrams that involve STL classes more
# complete and accurate.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that 
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of 
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name 
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are 
# omitted =1 is assumed.

# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional 
# documentation sections, marked by \if sectionname ... \endif.

# Because of how we construct the Python documentation, we don't want
# the first sentence to be assumed to be the brief description.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = NO

# Override the settings in doxygen-config-common.txt to refer to just
# the files relevant for the Python bindings.
