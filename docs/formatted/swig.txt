OVERVIEW

   libSBML is written in C and C++, but thanks to the "SWIG
   bindings", you can write programs in other languages that call
   upon libSBML.  Currently there are SWIG bindings for Python
   and Java.

   SWIG is the "Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator".  SWIG
   generates "wrapper code" to allow subroutine C and C++
   programs to be called from other languages.  The SWIG project
   was started and is run by David Beazley at http://www.swig.org.

   A "SWIG binding" is a machine-readable set of descriptions
   that tells SWIG how to build the bridge between some C/C++
   code and other languages that want to call it.

   Fortunately, you don't need to know anything about SWIG to
   use the libSBML SWIG bindings.  The rest of this document
   shows you how to write programs in Python and Java that use
   the features of libSBML.  You will need to know only the very
   basics of Python or Java, whichever you prefer to use.

PYTHON TUTORIAL

   For this tutorial, we'll assume that you're running on some
   variant of Unix.  (That includes Linux and Mac OS X.)  @@say
   something about Windows

   When you installed libSBML, you already installed the SWIG
   bindings.
