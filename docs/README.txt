		      l i b S B M L  Documentation

			     10 August 2010

Due to the size of the documentation available for libSBML, we do not
distribute the documentation as part of either the binary installers or
the source distribution.  Instead, the libSBML documentation is made
available from the following locations:

1) http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/

   The above URL is the primary libSBML download site, from where the
   libSBML binary installers are made available.  In that location you
   will find a separate installer for the documentation files.  To
   install the documentation, unpack the documentation archive in the
   same location where you unpacked the libSBML binary installer.

2) http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML
   
   The above URL is the website for libSBML.  The documentation is
   available for viewing online from there; no downloading or
   installation is necessary.

Please see the file ../README.txt for more information about this
installation of libSBML, or please see http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML
for more information about libSBML itself.

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!

The SBML Team.
