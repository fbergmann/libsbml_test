## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**
###Experimental installers for Microsoft Windows operating systems

This directory contains binary versions of libSBML compiled with plug-ins
supporting draft SBML Level 3 package specifications for Microsoft Windows
systems.

We do not supply a windows installer, *per se*. The archives supplied include all the necessary library and include files as well as the relevant binaries for each of the language bindings. 

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!

The LibSBML Team.
