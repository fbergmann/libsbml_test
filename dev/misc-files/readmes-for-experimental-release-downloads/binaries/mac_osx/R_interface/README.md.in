## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**
###R interface for Mac OS X operating systems

This directory contains the libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental) package files for R.  

Please navigate to either the [Source Package](Source%20Package) or [Binary Package](Binary%20Package) folder to select your preferred installation method.  

The binary installation will provide a faster installation but will only work if the version of R being used matches the version used to create the installer (R v3.0 in this instance).  The source package will invoke a build within R and create the appropriate package for whichever R version is being used.


Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.
