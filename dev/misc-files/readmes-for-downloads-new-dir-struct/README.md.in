##libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@

LibSBML is a free, open-source programming library to help you read,
write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data
streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with
example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own
applications.

This is the top-level directory of the libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ release. Here you
will find the following:

*  [stable](stable)       -- subdirectory for the stable release of libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@
  
*  [experimental](experimental) -- subdirectory for libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@ with beta package code

The `stable` directory contains the fully tested source, documentation
and binary installers that reflect the current stable libSBML core and any 
accepted SBML L3 packages.

The `experimental` directory contains source code for packages still in
development, as well as binaries containing libSBML core
together with all the packages included. Items in the `experimental`
directory may be untested and undocumented, and are supplied as-is.

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!
