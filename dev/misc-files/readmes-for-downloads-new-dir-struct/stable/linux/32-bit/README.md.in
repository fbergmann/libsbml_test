## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ installers for 32-bit Linux operating systems**

**Important**: Before you install libSBML using these installers, please **uninstall any existing copy of libSBML** located in the same destination on your computer, or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components on your system.


### **_C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Perl, R and Ruby installers_**

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ for 32-bit Linux systems.  They were built with the libxml2 parser library, and include accepted SBML Level 3 packages plus interfaces for the following programming languages:

* C
* C++
* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Javascript
* Perl
* Ruby
	
[The directory named "R interface"](R%20interface) contains the standalone installer for the R libSBML library, without the other languages.  For the remaining languages listed above, download one of the following installer files and run it:

* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm) -- for RPM-based Linux distributions (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS)
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb) -- for Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu & variants, Debian)
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for CentOS
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for Ubuntu

By default, the installer will put libSBML into `/usr`.  Detailed information about how to make libSBML accessible to your software [is available on a separate web page](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-accessing.html).


### **_Python installers_**

If you are primarily interested in Python, we provide two better options for installing libSBML for Python:

* **_Using PiPI_**: First, make sure you have the following prerequisite software packages installed on your operating system: `python-dev`, `libxml2-dev`, `libz-dev`, and `libbz2-dev`.  Then, you can use the following command to install libSBML for Python: `sudo pip install python-libsbml`

* **_Using `apt-get` or `yum`_**: Python installers for use with `apt-get` or `yum` for various Linux distributions can be obtained from the [Open Build Service](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Afbergman%3Alibsbml&package=python-libsbml "Open Build Service").

After you have installed the Python libSBML library, follow the instructions for [how to access libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/libsbml-accessing.html).


### **_MATLAB and Octave_**

If you need the MATLAB/Octave language interfaces, or need to use a different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML yourself from the source distribution using suitable configuration flags.  The procedure is described in [the libSBML documentation](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-installation.html).  The source and documentation are available from the top-level download directory, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@).


### **_Additional information_**
