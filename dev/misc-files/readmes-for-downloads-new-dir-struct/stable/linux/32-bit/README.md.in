###Installers for 32-bit Linux operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination on your computer before you install libSBML using
these installers, or you may end up with mixed versions of different
libSBML components on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML
for 32-bit Linux systems.  All copies were built using the libxml2 XML
parser library and contain code for libSBML core plus any accepted SBML L3
packages.  The following language interfaces are also contained:

* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Perl
* Ruby
	
Here you will find the following files:

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm)
       -- for RPM-based Linux distributions (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS)

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb)
       -- for Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu & variants, Debian)

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz)
       -- an archive containing just the binary files built for centos

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz)

If you need the MATLAB/Octave or Python language interfaces, or need to use a
different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML yourself
from the source distribution using suitable configuration flags.  The
procedure is described in the libSBML documentation.  The source and
documentation are available from the top-level download directory,
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@)
