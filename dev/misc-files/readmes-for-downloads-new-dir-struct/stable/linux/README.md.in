###Installers for Linux operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination on your computer before you install libSBML using
these installers, or you may end up with mixed versions of different
libSBML components on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML
for Linux systems.  All copies were built using the libxml2 XML parser
library and contain code for libSBML core plus any accepted SBML L3
packages.  The following language interfaces are also contained:

* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Perl
* Ruby
	
* R (as a separate installer)

Please navigate to either the [32-bit](32-bit) or [64-bit](64-bit) folders, to match the
version of the operating system you are using.

If you need the MATLAB/Octave or python language interfaces, or need to use a
different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML yourself
from the source distribution using suitable configuration flags.  The
procedure is described in the libSBML documentation.  The source and
documentation are available from the top-level download directory,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@

For additional information about this version of libSBML, please see
