###Installers for 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination on your computer before you install libSBML using
these installers, or you may end up with mixed versions of different
libSBML components on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML for
Microsoft Windows 32-bit systems.  All copies were built using the libxml2
XML parser library and contain code for libSBML core plus any accepted SBML
L3 packages.  The following language interfaces are also contained:

* C# (Mono)
* Java
* MATLAB
* Octave
* Perl
* Ruby
	
Here you will find the following files:

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe)

      Complete libSBML binary distribution.

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-matlab-fbc-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-matlab-fbc-x86.exe)

      Installer for the MATLAB libSBML interface ONLY.  Download this
      if you ONLY need to use libSBML from MATLAB.  (This installer is
      also contained within [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe), so if you
      downloaded that, you do NOT need to download and install this
      MATLAB interface installer in addition.) 
      
      (Note: The MATLAB interface supports SBML core and the L3 fbc package only.)

  * [Python](Python)

      This folder contains installers for the Python libSBML interface
      ONLY, for different versions of Python.  Download and use one of
      these installers if you only need the Python interface.  (The
      interface is also included within [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe), so
      if you downloaded that, you do NOT need to download and install
      the Python interface installer separately.)

  * [R interface](R%20interface)

      This folder contains installer for the R libSBML interface ONLY.
