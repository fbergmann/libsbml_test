##libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@
###Installers for Microsoft Windows operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination on your computer before you install libSBML using
these installers, or you may end up with mixed versions of different
libSBML components on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML for
Microsoft Windows systems.  All copies were built using the libxml2 XML
parser library and contain code for libSBML core plus any accepted SBML L3
packages.  The following language interfaces are also contained:

* C# (Mono)
* Java
* MATLAB
* Octave (32 bit only)
* Perl
* Python
	
* R (as a separate installer)
	
Please navigate to either the [32-bit](32-bit) or [64-bit](64-bit) folders, to match the
version of the operating system you are using.

If you need to use a different XML parser library, you will need to build
libSBML yourself from the source distribution using suitable configuration
flags.  The procedure is described in the libSBML documentation.  The source
and documentation are available from the top-level download directory,
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@)

For additional information about this version of libSBML, please see
