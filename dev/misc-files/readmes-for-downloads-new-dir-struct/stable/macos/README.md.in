##libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@
###Installers for Mac OS X operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination on your computer before you install libSBML using
these installers, or you may end up with mixed versions of different
libSBML components on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML for
Mac OS X systems.  All were built with the Apple-supplied libxml2 XML parser
library and contain code for libSBML core plus any accepted SBML L3 packages.
The following language interfaces are also contained:

* C# (Mono)
* Java
* MATLAB
* Perl
* Python
* Ruby

If you need the Octave language interface, or need to use a different 
XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML yourself 
from the source distribution using suitable configuration flags.  
The procedure is described in the libSBML documentation.  The source 
and documentation are available from the top-level download directory, 
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@)

By default, the installer will put the contents in `/usr/local`, but
this location can be changed from the installer interface.

To uninstall libSBML, please run the following command in your
terminal:

	sudo /usr/local/bin/uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh

(If you chose to install libSBML into a directory tree other than
`/usr/local`, then please look for the `uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh` script
in the `bin` directory of that alternate location.)

For additional information about this version of libSBML, please see
